My name is Luca Cristiano, known online as Zekromaster (and as Zekromaster42 in
places where someone else is already known as Zekromaster).

I'm an italian developer, Free Software activist, and university student in 
Software Engineering.

This is the fifth time I build my own personal website, hoping it's also the 
last.

For why this website looks like it came straight from Tim Berners Lee's IBM 
Terminal: link:blog/why_this_site_sucks[see here].

This blog's main focus is the hobby side of my life - Videogames, Tabletop RPGs, a probably unhealthy dose of software
engineering. I may consider making it tag-browseable in the future, for the sake of those poor employers who'd
otheriwise have to sift through my D&D ramblings to find out why I considered this site relevant enough to my 
professional life to put it on my resume, and for those who just want to read about a specific topic.
