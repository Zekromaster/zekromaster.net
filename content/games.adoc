This page exists to allow me to brag about my videogame accomplishments.

== Retroachievements

My my https://retroachievements org/user/Zekromaster[Retroachievements user page] contains information about games I've played (and gained achievements in) in emulators supporting RetroAchievements, starting from March 2024.

I have replayed some games explicitly to get achievements, so there is some overlap between this profile and the list below, and hopefully there will be more as I play and finish more games.
