"Zekromaster, why does this website suck" you tell me.

"Why aren't you using all the thingamajigs and the funny doodads that modern 
web development gives us?"

And I hear you alright. We have modern CSS, and TypeScript building to 
JavaScript, and complex rube-goldberg machines that make writing an 
"Hello, World" something like this

```python
    import library;
    import another_library;
    import database;

    database.connect(
        library.getAWSLambda("watchamacallit")
    )

    world = database.get(
        """
            SELECT WORLD
            FROM WORLDS
            WHERE USER='ME'
        """
    )

    world.push(
        another_library
        .deploy_anti_bobby_table_measures(
            0
        )
    )

    world.callPrintfAsAService(
        "Hello, %s"
    )
```
Yet, as you may have noticed from the syntax highlighting above, I'm actually
using something developed after the Ides of March for my website.

This website is made with Hugo, using 
https://github.com/Zekromaster/HugoTheme-Plain[a theme I made myself called Plain]

You see, I had a personal website multiple times in my life. It started as a
Wordpress blog, made in one night and where I posted movie and videogame 
reviews. Then I started doing webdev, and the website became an horrible beast
made by an high school student with too much time on their hands who built his
own horrible CMS in Javascript running entirely on a directory full of `.json`
files.

Sometime around my second year of university (I do study Software Engineering) I
realized I needed to simplify my website, and moved to Hugo. This didn't last 
long, though it lead me to developing another Hugo theme, 
https://github.com/Zekromaster/HugoTheme-BackToThe90s[Back to the 90s].

I later went back to using the "coolest" things around to make my website, and 
started making something with Strapi and Angular. I have been websiteless for
months now, waiting to make the "perfect Angular frontend for my personal API".

And then, it hit me, right in the stomach. _Why am I doing all this?_. I 
literally only want to host a personal blog, and a list of games I want to brag
about completing 100%.

I threw away all the fancy CSS, and the animations, and the GUI work I did. I
don't _need_ all that, I need to display content, and you know what's made to 
display content? Static HTML. Static, minimal, almost-css-less HTML. And it 
comes with the plus of being free on DigitalOcean.

Now, that isn't to say I'm not gonna use anything "too fancy" on my website. I
already have plans to add some "progressive enhancement" features, first of all
a searchbar - but fancy features are _not_ the focus of this website. The focus 
of this website is being a personal blog. And it's working well as a personal 
blog as it is.
