In the beginning, I intended to write a very short rant for a Facebook group I'm
in. Then, I realized I have a LOT to say about this, and thus launched VSCode as
this turned into the first post of what I plan to be a series about how D&D can't
model every single setting.

In each post, I'll give a brief comment on a specific setting adapted or published
for D&D. All of them can give us unique insights into how D&D fails at delivering
certain experiences or succeeds at delivering others, and how the universalizing
approach of D&D 5e actually reduced the game’s ability to deliver on what used to
be its core premises.

At the end of each comment, I’ll briefly explain, in my opinion, what this means
for D&D 5e in relation to the setting and what other systems would do a good or
better job at modeling the narratives the setting is focused on. For the sake of
getting people to actually try out those systems, I'll link to official pages and
try to go with more widely-known and supported systems that can model large amounts of
the setting's intended experience instead of smaller specific ones, unless I feel
a system fits too well to not mention.
